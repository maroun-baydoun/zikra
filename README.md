# Zikra

## Putting the pieces back together

### What is Zikra?

_Zikra_, Arabic for memory, is a simple puzzle game based on the photos I've been taking over the years. It was born out of my desire to:

- Make something cool with CSS' `background-size` and `backgroun-position` properties.
- Use my photos in creative ways.
- Build and ship an app using web components exclusively.
